	abstract = {Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has been widely spread. We aim to investigate the clinical characteristic and allergy status of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. Methods Electronic medical records including demographics, clinical manifestation, comorbidities, laboratory data, and radiological materials of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with confirmed result of SARS-CoV-2 viral infection, were extracted and analyzed. Results An approximately 1:1 ratio of male (50.7\%) and female COVID-19 patients was found, with an overall median age of 57.0 years. All patients were community-acquired cases. Fever (91.7\%), cough (75.0\%), fatigue (75.0\%), and gastrointestinal symptoms (39.6\%) were the most common clinical manifestations, whereas hypertension (30.0\%) and diabetes mellitus (12.1\%) were the most common comorbidities. Drug hypersensitivity (11.4\%) and urticaria (1.4\%) were self-reported by several patients. Asthma or other allergic diseases were not reported by any of the patients. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, 1.4\%) patients and current smokers (1.4\%) were rare. Bilateral ground-glass or patchy opacity (89.6\%) was the most common sign of radiological finding. Lymphopenia (75.4\%) and eosinopenia (52.9\%) were observed in most patients. Blood eosinophil counts correlate positively with lymphocyte counts in severe (r = .486, P {\textless} .001) and nonsevere (r = .469, P {\textless} .001) patients after hospital admission. Significantly higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were associated with severe patients compared to nonsevere patients (all P {\textless} .001). Conclusion Detailed clinical investigation of 140 hospitalized COVID-19 cases suggests eosinopenia together with lymphopenia may be a potential indicator for diagnosis. Allergic diseases, asthma, and COPD are not risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Older age, high number of comorbidities, and more prominent laboratory abnormalities were associated with severe patients.},

	abstract = {Background 
        Since early December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused pneumonia epidemic in Wuhan, Hubei province of China. This study aimed to investigate the factors affecting the progression of pneumonia in COVID-19 patients. Associated results will be used to evaluate the prognosis and to find the optimal treatment regimens for COVID-19 pneumonia.
        Methods 
        Patients tested positive for the COVID-19 based on nucleic acid detection were included in this study. Patients were admitted to 3 tertiary hospitals in Wuhan between December 30, 2019, and January 15, 2020. Individual data, laboratory indices, imaging characteristics, and clinical data were collected, and statistical analysis was performed. Based on clinical typing results, the patients were divided into a progression group or an improvement/stabilization group. Continuous variables were analyzed using independent samples t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical variables were analyzed using Chi-squared test or Fisher's exact test. Logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the risk factors for disease progression.
        Results 
        Seventy-eight patients with COVID-19-induced pneumonia met the inclusion criteria and were included in this study. Efficacy evaluation at 2 weeks after hospitalization indicated that 11 patients (14.1\%) had deteriorated, and 67 patients (85.9\%) had improved/stabilized. The patients in the progression group were significantly older than those in the disease improvement/stabilization group (66 [51, 70] vs. 37 [32, 41] years, U = 4.932, P = 0.001). The progression group had a significantly higher proportion of patients with a history of smoking than the improvement/stabilization group (27.3\% vs. 3.0\%, χ2 = 9.291, P = 0.018). For all the 78 patients, fever was the most common initial symptom, and the maximum body temperature at admission was significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (38.2 [37.8, 38.6] vs. 37.5 [37.0, 38.4]°C, U = 2.057, P = 0.027). Moreover, the proportion of patients with respiratory failure (54.5\% vs. 20.9\%, χ2 = 5.611, P = 0.028) and respiratory rate (34 [18, 48] vs. 24 [16, 60] breaths/min, U = 4.030, P = 0.004) were significantly higher in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group. C-reactive protein was significantly elevated in the progression group compared to the improvement/stabilization group (38.9 [14.3, 64.8] vs. 10.6 [1.9, 33.1] mg/L, U = 1.315, P = 0.024). Albumin was significantly lower in the progression group than in the improvement/stabilization group (36.62 ± 6.60 vs. 41.27 ± 4.55 g/L, U = 2.843, P = 0.006). Patients in the progression group were more likely to receive high-level respiratory support than in the improvement/stabilization group (χ2 = 16.01, P = 0.001). Multivariate logistic analysis indicated that age (odds ratio [OR], 8.546; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.628–44.864; P = 0.011), history of smoking (OR, 14.285; 95\% CI: 1.577–25.000; P = 0.018), maximum body temperature at admission (OR, 8.999; 95\% CI: 1.036–78.147, P = 0.046), respiratory failure (OR, 8.772, 95\% CI: 1.942–40.000; P = 0.016), albumin (OR, 7.353, 95\% CI: 1.098–50.000; P = 0.003), and C-reactive protein (OR, 10.530; 95\% CI: 1.224−34.701, P = 0.028) were risk factors for disease progression.
        Conclusions 
        Several factors that led to the progression of COVID-19 pneumonia were identified, including age, history of smoking, maximum body temperature at admission, respiratory failure, albumin, and C-reactive protein. These results can be used to further enhance the ability of management of COVID-19 pneumonia.},

Cell entry of coronaviruses depends on binding of the viral spike (S) proteins to cellular receptors and on S protein priming by host cell proteases. Unravelling which cellular factors are used by SARS-CoV-2 for entry might provide insights into viral transmission and reveal therapeutic targets. Here, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 uses the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 for entry and the serine protease TMPRSS2 for S protein priming. A TMPRSS2 inhibitor approved for clinical use blocked entry and might constitute a treatment option. Finally, we show that the sera from convalescent SARS patients cross-neutralized SARS-2-S-driven entry. Our results reveal important commonalities between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection and identify a potential target for antiviral intervention.},

Design, participants and setting: Prospective case series of 112 patients admitted to seven hospitals in Melbourne with laboratory-confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza between 1 May and 17 July 2009. Main outcome measures: Details of case characteristics, risk factors for severe disease, treatment and clinical course. Results: Of 112 hospitalised patients, most presented with cough (88\%) and/or fever (82\%), but several (4\%) had neither symptom. A quarter of female patients (15) were pregnant or in the post-partum period. Patients presenting with multifocal changes on chest x-ray had significantly longer hospital lengths of stay, and were more likely to require intensive care unit admission. Thirty patients required admission to an intensive care unit, and three died during their acute illness. The median length of intensive care admission was 10.5 days (interquartile range, 5–16 days). Conclusions: This study highlights risk factors for severe disease, particularly pregnancy. Clinical and public health planning for upcoming influenza seasons should take into account the spectrum and severity of clinical infection demonstrated in this report, and the need to concentrate resources effectively in high-risk patient groups.},

	abstract = {Background
Influenza is a common cause of severe respiratory illness, but risk factors for hospitalisation in low income settings with a high HIV prevalence are not well described. We aimed to assess risk factors associated with influenza-associated severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) hospitalisation in South Africa.
Methods
We conducted a case-population study using data on risk conditions in patients hospitalised with SARI and the national prevalence of these conditions. Data on hospitalised cases were from the national SARI surveillance program while data on the referent population were from the latest national census or health and demographic surveillance surveys.
Findings
From 2009 to 2012, we identified 3646 (7.9\%) of 46,031 enrolled cases of SARI that were associated with influenza infection. Risk factors associated with hospitalisation included previous history of smoking [case-population ratio (CPR) 3.82, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 3.5–4.16], HIV infection (CPR 3.61, 95\% CI 3.5–3.71), asthma (CPR 2.45, 95\% CI 2.19–2.73), previous history of hospital admission in the past 12months (CPR 2.07, 95\% CI 1.92–2.23), and tuberculosis (CPR 1.85, 95\% CI 1.68–2.02). When stratified by age, there is increased risk of hospitalisation in those ⩽5yearsof age (CPR 3.07, 95\% CI 2.93–3.21) and among those 35yearsof age and above (CPR 1.23, 95\% CI 1.28–1.18). Male sex (CPR 0.85, 95\% CI 0.82–0.88) and completion of pneumococcal conjugate vaccination schedule in children {\textless}5yearsof age (CPR 0.74, 95\% CI 0.71–0.77) were associated with decreased risk of hospitalisation.
Conclusion
These results identify groups at high-risk for severe influenza who should be considered potential targets for influenza vaccination in South Africa and similar settings.},

	abstract = {In current severe global emergency situation of 2019-nCov outbreak, it is imperative to identify vulnerable and susceptible groups for effective protection and care. Recently, studies found that 2019-nCov and SARS-nCov share the same receptor, ACE2. In this study, we analyzed five large-scale bulk transcriptomic datasets of normal lung tissue and two single-cell transcriptomic datasets to investigate the disparities related to race, age, gender and smoking status in ACE2 gene expression and its distribution among cell types. We didn\&rsquo;t find significant disparities in ACE2 gene expression between racial groups (Asian vs Caucasian), age groups (\&gt;60 vs \&lt;60) or gender groups (male vs female). However, we observed significantly higher ACE2 gene expression in former smoker\&rsquo;s lung compared to non-smoker\&rsquo;s lung. Also, we found higher ACE2 gene expression in Asian current smokers compared to non-smokers but not in Caucasian current smokers, which may indicate an existence of gene-smoking interaction. In addition, we found that ACE2 gene is expressed in specific cell types related to smoking history and location. In bronchial epithelium, ACE2 is actively expressed in goblet cells of current smokers and club cells of non-smokers. In alveoli, ACE2 is actively expressed in remodelled AT2 cells of former smokers. Together, this study indicates that smokers especially former smokers may be more susceptible to 2019-nCov and have infection paths different with non-smokers. Thus, smoking history may provide valuable information in identifying susceptible population and standardizing treatment regimen.},

	abstract = {Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) 18 years ago, a large number of SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) have been discovered in their natural reservoir host, bats1–4. Previous studies have shown that some bat SARSr-CoVs have the potential to infect humans5–7. Here we report the identification and characterization of a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV), which caused an epidemic of acute respiratory syndrome in humans in Wuhan, China. The epidemic, which started on 12 December 2019, had caused 2,794 laboratory-confirmed infections including 80 deaths by 26 January 2020. Full-length genome sequences were obtained from five patients at an early stage of the outbreak. The sequences are almost identical and share 79.6\% sequence identity to SARS-CoV. Furthermore, we show that 2019-nCoV is 96\% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus. Pairwise protein sequence analysis of seven conserved non-structural proteins domains show that this virus belongs to the species of SARSr-CoV. In addition, 2019-nCoV virus isolated from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of a critically ill patient could be neutralized by sera from several patients. Notably, we confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses the same cell entry receptor—angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2)—as SARS-CoV.},

In this study, we assessed the quality of smoking status captured in an electronic health record from a large academic medical center. We analyzed data from structured notes, finding that smoking status was documented in 98\% of 64,451 hospital encounters in 2016. 32\% hospital encounters had discrepant documentation, and 54.5\% of patients had implausible changes (e.g., changes from “current smoker” to “never smoker”). Overall, only 2.9\% of patients were documented as active smokers, but 36.4\% were documented as “unknown” or had discrepancies in their smoking status. These results suggest that patients that smoke are not appropriately identified. Centralized documentation with clinically actionable smoking status categories and implementation of patient-facing tools that allow patients to directly record their information could improve data quality of smoking status.},

	abstract = {Introduction
COVID-19 may predispose to both venous and arterial thromboembolism due to excessive inflammation, hypoxia, immobilisation and diffuse intravascular coagulation. Reports on the incidence of thrombotic complications are however not available.
Methods
We evaluated the incidence of the composite outcome of symptomatic acute pulmonary embolism (PE), deep-vein thrombosis, ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction or systemic arterial embolism in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU of 2 Dutch university hospitals and 1 Dutch teaching hospital.
Results
We studied 184 ICU patients with proven COVID-19 pneumonia of whom 23 died (13\%), 22 were discharged alive (12\%) and 139 (76\%) were still on the ICU on April 5th 2020. All patients received at least standard doses thromboprophylaxis. The cumulative incidence of the composite outcome was 31\% (95\%CI 20-41), of which CTPA and/or ultrasonography confirmed VTE in 27\% (95\%CI 17-37\%) and arterial thrombotic events in 3.7\% (95\%CI 0-8.2\%). PE was the most frequent thrombotic complication (n = 25, 81\%). Age (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.05/per year, 95\%CI 1.004-1.01) and coagulopathy, defined as spontaneous prolongation of the prothrombin time {\textgreater} 3 s or activated partial thromboplastin time {\textgreater} 5 s (aHR 4.1, 95\%CI 1.9-9.1), were independent predictors of thrombotic complications.
Conclusion
The 31\% incidence of thrombotic complications in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections is remarkably high. Our findings reinforce the recommendation to strictly apply pharmacological thrombosis prophylaxis in all COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU, and are strongly suggestive of increasing the prophylaxis towards high-prophylactic doses, even in the absence of randomized evidence.},
